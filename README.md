# Recipe-Search-Tool
A program that allows its users to search based on ingredients, and receive recipes that can be made using the ingredients searched with. 

To Use, change the "APP_ID" and "API_KEY"(line 12 in getRecipe.js) with your own ID and Key using the Edamam API. 

This project utilizes linked lists to display relevant recipes(based on what ingredients are searched, and the drop down "Sort By" filter). 

Eg. 
User searches for "tomato" with the Sort By filter set to "servings".

User is then given a list of recipes that use tomatoes and are filtered servings in ascending order.
